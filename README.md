# Action Combat

This project is the result of a course I took to explore creating third-person melee combat mechanics in Unreal Engine 5. The process helped me improve my C++ skills while building a dynamic combat system inspired by AAA games.

## About This Project

Through this project, I worked on advanced game development techniques in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. By the end of the course, I had created a functional third-person action game with the following features:

- **Enemy Lock-On System:** A camera lock-on component to simplify combat and help focus on gameplay rather than camera management.
- **Dynamic Player Combat:** A combat system that cycles through multiple attack animations, making gameplay feel more fluid and natural.
- **Scalable Stat System:** A flexible stat system built using maps and enums to ensure the game remains clean and easy to scale.
- **Advanced Enemy AI:** Enemies with behaviors like throwing fireballs and charging players, adding challenge and variety to the gameplay.
- **Clean and Scalable Code:** Over a thousand lines of C++ code written with design patterns like the Observer Pattern to keep the project maintainable.

## What I Learned

- Advanced C++ programming techniques specific to Unreal Engine 5.
- Building systems using interfaces, enums, and Unreal's documentation.
- Debugging effectively and maintaining clean, organized code.
- Using design patterns to create modular and reusable game logic.
- Converting Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints into C++ code.
